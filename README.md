# IPL Live Win Probability Predictor üèè

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the live win probability for the chasing team in an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket match. The model analyzes the state of the game after each ball in the second innings and calculates the likelihood of each team winning.

This was developed using Python and popular data science libraries, with the model trained on a historical dataset of IPL matches.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Live Prediction:** Calculates win probability based on the current match situation.
* **Dynamic Inputs:** Takes into account key match variables like runs needed, balls left, and wickets in hand.
* **Data-Driven:** Trained on a comprehensive ball-by-ball dataset from past IPL seasons.
* **Interactive Calculator:** Includes a command-line interface to input any match scenario and get an instant prediction.

## üöÄ How to Use

To run this project, you will need Python and the required libraries installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```
    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    ```
    Then, run the command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Get the data:**
    Download the `deliveries.csv` dataset. This project requires this ball-by-ball data file to be in the same directory as the script.

4.  **Run the script:**
    Execute the Python script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python predictor.py
    ```
    The script will train the model and then prompt you to enter the details of a live match scenario to get a prediction.

    ```
    ## Live Win Probability Calculator
    Enter the target score set by the first team: 185
    Enter runs needed to win: 45
    Enter balls left: 30
    Enter wickets left (1-10): 7
    ```
